<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Picarones or Peruvian doughnuts are a typical Peruvian treat and are as good as American Doughnuts but are easier to make. This is a traditional Picarones recipe that’s simple to make and the resulting Picarones will tempt you to devour them all.</p>
<p>This recipe uses butternut squash but you can also use pumpkin (which is part of the squash family) and sweet potato.</p>
<p>In fact, a mix of all three is a good way to change the flavors. This would not be considered an easy recipe but with a little care and some practice, you can make delicious desserts that accompany any Peruvian meal, especially anticuchos de corazón.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 Tbs. dry baking yeast</li>
    <li>1 tsp. sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
    <li>1 Tbs. ground corn or cornmeal</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp. sea salt</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp. crushed anise</li>
    <li>3 cups white flour</li>
    <li>1 cup premium beer</li>
    <li>1 cu[ cooked butternut squash <span class="suggestion">pureed</span></li>
    <li>1-2 cups brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>3 lemon or orange peel shreds</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Doughnut Instructions: Dissolve sugar and yeast in the warm water, use a small bowl for this.</li>
    <li>Mix cornmeal, salt, anise seed, 1 cup flour and beer in a large bowl. Add the yeast mixture and mix.</li>
    <li>Add squash or pumpkin and 2 cups of flour. Mix together to form a soft dough texture. Cover with a towel and let the mixture rise in a warm place for around 2 hours. You can also let the mixture rise in the refrigerator for 4 to 12 hours if covered with film.
    </li>
    <li>Syrup instructions: Add the Syrup ingredients in a saucepan and leave to boil over medium heat level. Reduce the heat to low and leave to simmer until a thick syrup forms after 15 minutes or so. Remove saucepan from heat.</li>
    <li>To prepare doughnuts: Heat oil in a wok. Drop tablespoons of dough into hot oil and fry until crispy golden. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot with hot syrup.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Helpful hints: To test for proper temperature, drop a small spoonful of dough into hot oil; if it rises quickly to the surface, the oil is hot enough.</p>
<p>If using the new quick-acting yeast, use half as much. Add to dry ingredients. Rising time will be reduced by about half.</p>
<p>To reheat doughnuts, place on baking sheets in a 350-degree oven until hot, about 5 minutes.</p>
