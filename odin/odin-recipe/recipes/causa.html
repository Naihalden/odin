<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is the Peruvian appetizer or starter par excellence: a perfect dough of mashed potato made with ají amarillo chili pepper layered with tuna fillet and a slight hint of mayonnaise topped off with a slice of boiled egg. </p>
<p>It is a dish that is served cold and is very refreshing. It is also very versatile, as it can be prepared with different fillings, such as chicken, octopus, avocado, prawns, etc.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>For the potato base:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 pounds floury potatoes</li>
    <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
    <li>3 aji amarillo chili peppers <span class="suggestion">very finely chopped</span></li>
    <li>Juice of two limes</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>A few sprigs of chopped parsley</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the filling:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>5 ounces of cannned or fresh tuna <span class="suggestion">1 can</span></li>
    <li>1/2 onion <span class="suggestion">chopped</span></li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of mayonnaise</li>
    <li>1/2 avocado <span class="suggestion">sliced</span></li>
    <li>2 hardboiled eggs <span class="suggestion">chopped into cubes</span></li>
    <li>1 aji limo chili pepper <span class="suggestion">chopped finely, or another similar chili pepper</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place the unpeeled potatoes in a large pot of cold water, adding 2 tablespoons of salt. Bring it to a boil and boil the potatoes until they’re cooked and soft. Strain and set aside to cool.</li>
    <li>When the potatoes have cooled sufficiently, remove the skin. Pass them through a potato ricer three times until the dough achieves a smooth and soft consistency. Add the olive oil, ají amarillo peppers, salt and pepper to taste and the sprigs of parsley. Knead the potato dough until you get a pliable and form texture.</li>
    <li>To serve, use a greased 3-inch diameter mini-springform pan to help you put each individual causa together. Spread the potato dough on the base, about 1 inch high. Then place a layer of avocado slices, followed by a layer of the tuna filling, and finish your causa with another 1 inch layer of potato dough. Remove the springform and repeat 3 more times.</li>
    <li>Decorate each serving with chopped egg and ají limo chili pepper, and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This is a starter served cold, and can be kept in the fridge for a few hours (up to a maximum of 12 hours) but flavor-wise it really tastes best when it has just been prepared.</p>
